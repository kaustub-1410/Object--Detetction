# Object Detection using Python & YOLOv3

This repository contains a Python implementation of the YOLOv3 object detection model using TensorFlow. It includes scripts for loading pre-trained YOLOv3 weights, converting them to TensorFlow format, and performing object detection (e.g., via a webcam).

## Overview

YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. This repository demonstrates how to:
- Load and convert YOLOv3 pre-trained weights into a TensorFlow checkpoint.
- Use the converted model to perform object detection on images or live video streams.

## Features

- **Model Conversion:** Load official YOLOv3 weights and convert them for TensorFlow usage.
- **Real-Time Detection:** Demo scripts to run object detection on live webcam feed.
- **Modular Codebase:** Easily extend or modify the code for custom use cases.

## Requirements

- **Python:** 3.6 or later
- **TensorFlow:** 2.x (with TF1 compatibility enabled)
- **OpenCV:** For handling image/video inputs
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Object--Detection.git
   cd Object--Detection
